# personalWeb
This web will have a summary of what I have completed (or in progress). Although most of these projects will not be all of the ones I have completed/worked on, they are meant to give an idea of what knowledge I bring. These projects can extend from GitHub projects to other platforms (Unity).

This web page will also have most of my contact information. Where on the web can you reach out?
