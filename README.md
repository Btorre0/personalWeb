# personalWeb
this web will have a little summary of what I have completed (or in progress). Although, most of these projects will not be all of the ones I have completed / worked on, they are meant to give an idea of what knowledge I bring to the table. These projects can extend from github projects, to other platforms (Unity).

This web will also have most of my contact information on where on the web you could reach out.
